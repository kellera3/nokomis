## Echoes of the Mountain – Side Encounter: The Hollow Pack

### 📌 Placement

This encounter can be inserted at either of two points:

| Placement | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Before Part I-A** (between the rescue and Aani's cabin) | The party encounters predators before they understand what skinwalkers are — only after meeting Aani and Nokomis will this encounter click into context. Creates retroactive dread. |
| **After Part I-A** (between Aani's cabin and the campground) | The party now understands what skinwalkers are supposed to be. Seeing a corrupted version immediately after Aani makes the contrast hit harder. Nokomis can later confirm who these people were and what happened to them. |

### 📌 DM Reference — Who They Are

The Hollow Pack is a small band of skinwalkers who broke from their kinship years ago. They did not go to the sorcerer willingly — they fled *toward* him, drawn by the promise of power he whispered to the desperate and the outcast. He gave them something: a fragment of harvested totem energy, stolen from other skinwalkers and fed back to them like scraps. It was enough to make them stronger. It was also enough to begin hollowing them out.

They are not fully consumed — not yet. They still shift, still hunt, still speak. But something in the way they move is wrong. Their animal forms hold too long. Their human faces have begun to blur at the edges, features sliding slightly when they are not concentrating. They feel it happening and they do not care. The power is worth it.

They operate as hunters and scouts for the sorcerer — intercepting travelers moving toward the mountain, eliminating those who seem dangerous, and occasionally delivering useful captives. They travel in groups of three or four, always with one member holding back in animal form to watch the perimeter.

**What they want from this encounter:** To assess the party. If the party looks weak, they will attack. If the party looks capable, their leader may attempt to recruit, intimidate, or simply let them pass — gathering information to report back.

**What they do not want:** A prolonged fight in the open. They are hunters, not soldiers. They prefer ambush, and if the ambush fails they will disengage.

### 🎙️ Read-Aloud (First Contact — Sensing Something Wrong)

Read this before the party sees anyone. Slow and quiet.

> The trees here are older. The spacing between them has widened, snow settling in unbroken sheets across the ground between the trunks.
>
> You hear nothing. No wind. No birds.
>
> Then: movement. Not sudden — gradual. A shape stepping out from behind a pine, perhaps thirty feet ahead. Human-shaped. A second figure emerging from the left, further back. A third somewhere in the trees to the right — you can feel it more than see it.
>
> They are not hiding. They stopped hiding the moment you entered this stretch of forest.
>
> The figure ahead is broad-shouldered, dressed in layered furs and leather, face partially wrapped against the cold. When the wind shifts, something about their outline seems to waver — like heat rising from stone, though the air is freezing.
>
> They do not speak first.
>
> They are waiting to see what you do.

---

### 🎙️ Read-Aloud (If the Party Holds Still or Approaches Cautiously)

> The lead figure tilts their head — a slow, birdlike movement, slightly too far to one side.
>
> When they speak, their voice is level. Unhurried. Like something that has learned to sound patient.
>
> "You smell like the wagons." A pause. "You got out."
>
> Their eyes catch the light differently than they should. Not the bright flash of an animal — something duller, deeper, like the reflection of a fire that isn't there.
>
> "Where are you going?"

### 📌 DM Reference — The Conversation

The leader, **Vesh**, will speak for the group. The others do not move during conversation — they hold position, watching. The one in the trees has not shown itself.

**Vesh's goals in conversation:**
- Find out if the party is heading toward Nokomis' camp
- Gauge whether the party is a threat or a resource
- Decide: attack, recruit, or let pass

**What Vesh may say:**

- *"Nokomis sends people to die on that mountain. He always has. He calls it debt."*
- *"We serve something older than kinship loyalty. Something that keeps its promises."*
- *"You could walk away from all of it. We did."*
- *"Or you could be useful to us. The mountain pays well for the right kind of help."*

**Vesh will lie freely.** The sorcerer does not keep promises. Vesh knows this and does not care — the power is still real, even if the cost was not disclosed.

[Battle ambience — start the moment Vesh attacks or a player draws a weapon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5LWRU_RyBg&list=RDC5LWRU_RyBg&start_radio=1)

---

**Vesh will attack if:**
- The party explicitly heads toward Nokomis' camp and refuses to be deterred
- A player attacks or draws a weapon first
- The party seems weak enough that taking them is worth the effort
- The party reveals they know about the ritual or the mine's true purpose

**Vesh will let the party pass if:**
- They seem genuinely lost or disinterested in the mountain
- The party is clearly capable and the ambush advantage is gone
- A player succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check and convinces Vesh they are no threat

**Vesh will attempt to recruit if:**
- A player expresses distrust of Nokomis or skepticism about the debt
- A player asks about what the sorcerer offers

### ⚔️ Combat Setup

**Enemies:**
- **Vesh** — the leader (use stat block below)
- **2 Hollow Pack Hunters** — flanking positions
- **1 Hollow Pack Watcher** — in animal form in the trees; joins combat on round 2

**Terrain:**
- Wide spacing between old pines — no dense cover. Players cannot easily hide.
- Snow is deep and wind-hardened — difficult terrain if moving off the packed trail (costs double movement)
- Trees provide half cover (+2 AC and Dex saves) if a creature is within 5 ft. of one

**Tactical notes:**
- The Watcher enters on round 2 from an unexpected angle (behind the party, or from above if using a bird form)
- Vesh focuses on the most capable-looking PC and does not switch targets unless downed
- Hunters use Pack Tactics and try to flank — they will not charge into a tight defensive formation
- If Vesh drops to 20 HP or below, she calls the retreat: *"Enough. Remember their faces."* The pack disengages and vanishes into the trees. They will not pursue.

**Flee Option:**
- Any PC who uses the Dash action and moves off the trail into the trees must succeed on a **DC 12 Dexterity** check each round or fall prone in the deep snow
- The Hollow Pack will not chase more than 200 feet from the encounter site — they are hunters, not committed soldiers
- If the whole party flees, Vesh watches them go and does not follow. She files the encounter away.

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |

---

**Shapechanger.** Vesh can use her bonus action to polymorph into a wolf-hybrid form or back into her humanoid form. Her statistics are the same in both forms except her speed increases to 50 ft. in wolf form and she cannot speak. Equipment does not transform with her.

**Hollow Totem.** Vesh's totem energy is stolen and unstable. She has advantage on Wisdom saving throws, but whenever she rolls a natural 1 on any saving throw, her form flickers visibly — features sliding, outline blurring — and she is incapacitated until the end of her next turn as the stolen energy reasserts itself.

**Pack Tactics.** Vesh has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of her allies is within 5 feet of that creature and the ally is not incapacitated.

**Keen Smell.** Vesh has advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell.

---

**Actions**

**Multiattack.** Vesh makes two attacks: two Shortsword attacks in humanoid form, or one Bite and one Claw attack in wolf form.

**Shortsword (humanoid form).** *Melee weapon attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1d6+3 piercing damage.

**Bite (wolf form).** *Melee weapon attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2d6+3 piercing damage. The target must succeed on a **DC 13 Strength saving throw** or be knocked prone.

**Claw (wolf form).** *Melee weapon attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1d6+3 slashing damage.

**Hollow Howl (Recharge 5-6).** Vesh releases a distorted howl — not quite wolf, not quite human. Each creature within 30 feet that can hear her must succeed on a **DC 13 Wisdom saving throw** or be frightened of her until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds is immune to this ability for 24 hours.

---

**Reactions**

**Predator's Step.** When a creature within 5 feet of Vesh stands up from prone, she may make one melee attack against that creature as a reaction.

**Pack Tactics.** The Hunter has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of that creature and the ally is not incapacitated.

**Handaxe.** *Melee or ranged weapon attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1d6+2 slashing damage.

### 🐺 Hollow Pack Watcher — Stat Block

The Watcher holds its animal form until round 2, then shifts to attack from an unexpected angle.

### 🔸 Aftermath

However the encounter resolves, it plants seeds for later.

**If the party fought them off:**
- Vesh and any survivors vanish into the trees. She is not dead. She remembers this.
- When the party reaches Nokomis' camp, he recognizes the description — *"The Hollow Pack. They have been the sorcerer's eyes in these woods for two seasons. I am glad you are alive."*
- This encounter is the first proof the sorcerer has agents who were once kin.

**If the party was recruited or let pass:**
- Vesh files the encounter as non-threatening and reports it to the sorcerer. The party may later discover they were reported — guards at the mine were warned, or something in the mine seems to expect them.

**If a player engaged seriously with Vesh's pitch:**
- Consider tracking this as a thread. Vesh is not irredeemable — she is just someone who made a deal she did not fully understand. If the party later demonstrates what the sorcerer's power actually costs, there is a seed of something here worth pulling.
