## Echoes of the Mountain – Part I-A: The Mother of Spiders

### 🎙️ Read-Aloud (Approaching the Cliffside Cabin)

Read slowly, eerie but not immediately threatening.

> Following the trail Nokomis’ messenger indicated, you move deeper into the forest.
>
> The snow grows heavier here, clinging to the needles of ancient pines. The wind drops away, replaced by a strange, muffled silence.
>
> Ahead, the path dips toward a cliffside, where a small dugout cabin is built directly into the rock face. Smoke trickles weakly from a crooked chimney.
> The structure looks old, weathered, half-swallowed by the mountain itself.
>
> As you approach, a faint chittering sound drifts from inside… like hundreds of tiny claws skittering across wood.
>
> The door stands slightly open.
>
> Inside, a dim orange glow pulses like a dying ember.

### 🎙️ Read-Aloud (Inside the Cabin)

Use a soft, unsettling tone.

> The air inside is warm but thick, almost sticky. A small fire burns at the back of the one-room shelter — just enough to cast quivering shadows on the walls.
>
> An old woman moves slowly around the room, her back hunched, her steps dragging softly across the wooden floor. Her hair hangs long and tangled, matted into thick ropes.
>
> Then you notice movement within it.
>
> Spiders.
>
> Dozens — maybe hundreds — nest in her hair, crawl along her shoulders, slip beneath the fabric of her tattered shawl. The walls themselves ripple with them, covering every inch in shifting black patterns.
>
> They cling to the ceiling. The bedposts. The hearth. Her.
>
> The woman does not seem to notice them.
>
> She turns to you with uneven, glassy eyes — one milky white, the other reflecting the firelight like an insect’s lens.
>
> “Oh…” she whispers, voice thin and layered, as though more than one throat speaks.
>
> “You’ve come back… have you?”

### 📌 DM Reference — Who She Is

- **Name**: Aani of the Web
- **Race**: Skinwalker (Spider-Totem), spiritually maimed
- **State**: Traumatized, soul partially detached, amnesiac
- **Alignment**: Neutral / Good (confused)

**Backstory Summary**

- **Captured Skinwalker**: Aani was a skinwalker captured and taken to the mine.
- **Interrupted Ritual**: The sorcerer began the ritual to rip out her soul to absorb the magic of the spider totem.
- **Half-Torn Soul**: The attack on the wagons interrupted the ritual mid-process.
- **Broken Escape**: Her soul was half-torn, leaving her unable to shapechange and barely tethered to her body.
- **Guided by Spiders**: She escaped blindly into the wilderness, guided only by her spider-kin.
- **Mother of Spiders**: The spiders built their home around her; she became their mother, their anchor.
- **Clarity & Fear**: She remembers nothing clearly, but she feels the evil in the mountain with perfect clarity.
- **Encounter Role**: She is not hostile unless frightened; intended as a roleplay-heavy encounter with eerie atmosphere and strong foreshadowing.

### 🧠 How Aani Behaves

- **Fragmented Speech**: Her speech is fragmented, often metaphorical.
- **Distant Attention**: She drifts mid-sentence, staring at corners as if listening to unseen voices.
- **Spider-Touch**: She may gently brush spiders off players’ shoulders — whether or not they are actually there.
- **Lucid Moments**: If comforted, she becomes lucid for brief flashes.
- **Defensive Swarms**: If threatened, the spiders become defensive, forming swarms — she herself will never intentionally attack.

### 🕷️ Information She Can Reveal (if prompted gently)

#### 1. About the Mine

Fragments of memories surface:

- “The stone… screams.”
- “He peels the spirit like silk… strand by strand…”
- “They don’t die in there. They… unravel.”

She cannot give full explanations — only broken truths.

#### 2. About the Sorcerer

She remembers his face only in nightmares.

- “His eyes… oh, his eyes… not man, not beast…”
- “He wants the strong spirits… the walking ones… the ones between forms…”
- “He tried to pull me away… my skin… my shape… my soul…”

Aani is the first proof that the sorcerer is not merely enslaving skinwalkers — he is harvesting them.

#### 3. The Ritual

She may touch a player’s cheek, whispering:

- “Your soul is bright… bright threads… don’t let him see you.”

Aani can show faint psychic echoes:

- a ritual circle  
- the feeling of your spirit being peeled away  
- the shape of antlers in firelight  
- a voice saying “More… bring me more…”

#### 4. Guidance Toward Nokomis

She may deliver this line with absolute clarity:

- “The owl-man waits for you.  
  His camp breathes behind the trees.  
  Go.  
  Before the mountain sees you.”

This is her one moment of calm.

### 🧵 Optional Roleplay Challenges

You may use any of the following to deepen the encounter:

#### 1. Aani’s Memory Test

If players show patience, empathy, or curiosity, she becomes clearer and may:

- grant them a hint about the sealed door  
- warn of a “bridge of heat and bone” (the magma chasm)  
- give them a small woven charm made of webbing (advantage vs. fear)

#### 2. Spider Behavior

Spiders respond to the emotional tone:

- **Calm** → spiders remain still  
- **Hostility** → walls ripple  
- **Loud noises** → swarms drop from the ceiling  
- **Healing offered** → spiders cluster protectively around Aani  

#### 3. Aani’s Panic

If players rush her, she recoils and the spiders form a trembling shield.

- She cries, “No more! No more peeling!”
- This should convey suffering, not enemy intent.

---

### 🗝️ Outcome of the Encounter

After speaking with Aani:

- She cannot travel with them — she is too broken.
- The spiders pull her gently into the shadows, comforting her.
- But she gives them a direction, a warning, or a clue.

### 🔸 Transition to Part II – The Campground

Use this as your transition line:

> As you step back into the cold, the cabin door creaks shut behind you.
>
> The skittering quiets.
>
> For a moment, the forest seems to breathe again —
>
> — and somewhere ahead, through the trees, a faint glow of firelight flickers.
>
> Nokomis’ people are waiting.
