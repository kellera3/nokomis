## Echoes of the Mountain – Part II: The Campground

### 🎙️ Read-Aloud (Arrival at the Camp)

Read slowly, let it feel heavy and mystical.

> You shoulder through dense pines; snow tumbles from the branches. The trees open into a grove large enough for a dozen teepees. Though the sun warmed the air when you entered the forest, night seems to have fallen here. The grove feels suspended in time—the air thick and stagnant, like murky pond water—yet beneath the stillness, a low, imperceptible hum vibrates in your bones.
>
> A rank odor hits your nose: sweat and smoke, mingled with something animal and wild. Figures move among scattered fires. The snow underfoot says the camp is new—days, a week at most. In the flickering light, outlines blur and waver as people slip unconsciously between human and animal form.
>
> The camp is hushed but not silent—murmured conversation, soft laughter, the rustle of feathers, the chittering of small forest creatures, the occasional low growl or hiss. A gaunt moose wanders near a fire; as it steps into the glow, its form ripples and becomes a hulking, skeletal man who lowers himself by the flames with a deep sigh.
>
> At the center rises a large, adorned teepee—painted feathers, skulls, talismans—clearly the leader’s dwelling. Dozens of shining eyes turn toward you in the dim firelight.

### 🎙️ Read-Aloud (Meeting Headman Nokomis)

(Voice: calm, wise, slightly mournful; deliberate.)

> “Greetings, travelers. I take your arrival as a sign of good intent toward our kind. I hope this is true, for we are in need of help. These are dark times for our small kinship. I have supplicated the Great Spirits without rest, begging for aid… and now you arrive. Tell me—will you be the hands the Great Spirits use to answer our call?”

### 📌 DM Reference – Camp Information

**If the party agrees to help:**

- **The Mine**: Beyond the peak lies the diamond mine, where molten rock nears the surface.
- **Slaves**: Caravans bring human slaves; none return.
- **Missing Skinwalkers**: Captured skinwalkers do not work the mine—they vanish.
- **Lingering Spirits**: Their spirits remain, sensed as agony, rage, and pain near the mine.
- **The Threat**: Something in that mountain steals the life of their kind.

**If the party asks about reward:**

- **Debt & Reward**: “You already owe a debt—your freedom. Still, the mine holds riches: gold, gems, treasures of the long-taken. Whatever you find, you may keep.”

- **Mood**: Ethereal, sacred, but unnerving.
- **Lighting**: Fires flicker; shadows move.
