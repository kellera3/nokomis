### Part-by-Part Overview

#### Part I – The Rescue

- **File**: [`part-1-the-rescue.md`](./part-1-the-rescue.md)  
- **Focus**: Violent, cinematic introduction and immediate hook.  
- **Suggested Level**: 1  
- **Key Beats**:
  - PCs are prisoners in slave wagons, suffering in a frozen wasteland.  
  - Skinwalkers (led by the owl-man) ambush the caravan and slaughter the captors.  
  - The owl-man offers the PCs freedom, and a choice: go their own way, or visit the camp to repay the debt.  
  - Party loots the wagons and recovers their starting gear from confiscated belongings.
- **DM Use**: Establish tone, brutality of the slavers, and the existence of skinwalkers as morally complex allies.
- **Sound**: Winter ambience track embedded at top of file.

#### Part I-A – The Mother of Spiders

- **File**: [`part-1a-mother-of-spiders.md`](./part-1a-mother-of-spiders.md)  
- **Placement**: Between Part I and Part II.  
- **Focus**: Roleplay-heavy horror and foreshadowing of the sorcerer and his rituals.  
- **Suggested Level**: 1  
- **Key Beats**:
  - PCs follow directions toward Nokomis' camp and find a cliffside cabin built into a cliffside.
  - Inside is **Aani of the Web** (CR 0), a spiritually maimed spider-totem skinwalker. Her HP represents soul integrity, not combat health — track separately using the Spiritual Health table in her file.
  - Aani's fragmented memories reveal: the mine screams, spirits are "peeled," and the sorcerer is harvesting skinwalkers.
  - Optional tunnel sequence beneath the cabin: The Shaft (skill challenge), The Web Crossing (skill challenge), The Blind Passage (combat — Silk Worms, CR 1/8), The Weaving Hall (navigation), The Elder Weaver's Chamber.
  - The **Elder Weaver** (CR 6) is not hostile unless attacked. She bites each party member as a ritual, granting the Widow's Gift boon and one individual boon per player.
  - Aani gives the party the **Widow's Molar** — a unique wondrous item that activates a Soul Revolt mechanic against the sorcerer when used.
- **DM Use**: Deepen dread, introduce the soul-harvesting ritual, and reward patient roleplay with meaningful mechanical boons.
- **Sound**: Spider cabin ambience embedded at cabin entry. Creepy violin sting embedded at the spider reveal. Underground cave ambience embedded at trapdoor descent. Battle ambience embedded at the Blind Passage.

#### Part II – The Campground

- **File**: [`part-2-the-campground.md`](./part-2-the-campground.md)  
- **Focus**: Social encounter, exposition, and alliance with Nokomis' kinship.  
- **Suggested Level**: 2 (award level-up on arrival)  
- **Key Beats**:
  - PCs arrive at a liminal, sacred-feeling skinwalker camp hidden in the forest.  
  - They meet **Headman Nokomis**, who asks for help against the mine and its vanished kin.  
  - Information about the mine: slave caravans, missing skinwalkers, lingering spirits of the dead, and something in the mountain that steals their life.  
  - Negotiation around reward (freedom-debt vs. treasure in the mine).  
  - Opportunity for the players to ask questions about the slavers, the spirits, and what lies atop and within the peak.
- **DM Use**: Clarify stakes, set goals ("go to the mine"), and define the relationship between party and skinwalkers before the descent into horror.

#### Part III – The Mine

- **File**: [`part-3-the-mine.md`](./part-3-the-mine.md)  
- **Focus**: First contact with the mine itself: atmosphere, conditions, and the looming presence of the Master in the mountain.  
- **Suggested Level**: 2–3  
- **Key Beats**:
  - PCs ascend toward the peak where magma presses close to the surface.  
  - They witness the slave pit: mud, ash, freezing humidity, and men dying in slow misery.  
  - Environmental hazards: choking steam (Perception disadvantage), exhaustion risk, warped light and oppressive soundscape.  
  - Discovery of dugouts (slave quarters, guard bunkhouse) and the **sealed ancient door**.  
  - Rumors and hints: the door opens on its own, entranced slaves walk through and never return, and an undying "Master" calls them.
  - **Mine Guards** (CR 1/2) patrol the pit — ex-prisoners, armed with pikes.
  - **The Master in the Mountain** — stat block not yet written; build to party level at time of encounter. Soul Revolt mechanic active if party carries the Widow's Molar.
- **DM Use**: Build dread and questions right before the players cross the threshold into whatever lies under the mountain.

### Side Encounters

These can be inserted at multiple points in the campaign. Each file includes a placement table explaining how the encounter's meaning shifts depending on when it lands.

#### Side Encounter – The Gorged

- **File**: [`side-encounter-the-gorged.md`](./side-encounter-the-gorged.md)  
- **Placement Options**: Before Part I-A / After Part I-A / After Part II  
- **Focus**: Atmospheric horror and evidence of the mine's body count.  
- **CR**: 3 — Deadly at level 1. Stealth bypass (group DC 13) is the intended path for a fresh party. Combat becomes viable at level 2.
- **Key Beats**:
  - Party hears something feeding in the trees.
  - Approaching reveals a corrupted cave bear feeding from a pile of dead mine workers.
  - The bodies show brutal working conditions — frostbite, tool wounds, starvation, the same food-sack clothing the party wore in the wagons.
  - The creature can be avoided with stealth or a distraction. If combat triggers, battle ambience cue is embedded in the file.
- **DM Use**: Make the mine's death toll visceral and personal before the party ever reaches it.

#### Side Encounter – The Hollow Pack

- **File**: [`side-encounter-the-hollow-pack.md`](./side-encounter-the-hollow-pack.md)  
- **Placement Options**: Before Part I-A / After Part I-A  
- **Focus**: First contact with the sorcerer's agents; moral complexity of corrupted skinwalkers.  
- **Monsters**: Vesh (CR 3 leader), 2x Hollow Pack Hunter (CR 1/2), 1x Hollow Pack Watcher (CR 1/4 — enters round 2 in bird form)  
- **Combined CR**: Deadly at level 1. Conversation and flee options are primary. Combat viable at level 2.
- **Key Beats**:
  - Three corrupted skinwalkers step out of the trees and wait. They do not hide.
  - Their leader **Vesh** speaks first — assessing the party, potentially attempting to recruit them for the sorcerer.
  - Players can fight, flee (Dex checks in deep snow), or talk their way through (DC 14 Charisma check).
  - Vesh retreats at 20 HP. The pack will not pursue beyond 200 feet.
  - Nokomis can identify the Hollow Pack by description when the party reaches camp — they are known to him.
- **DM Use**: Prove the sorcerer has agents in the forest. Introduce moral grey area — Vesh is not beyond redemption.
- **Sound**: Battle ambience cue embedded at the moment Vesh attacks.

### Suggested Flow at the Table

| Session | Content | Suggested Level |
|---|---|---|
| **Session 1** | Part I – The Rescue; one or both side encounters; Part I-A – The Mother of Spiders | 1 |
| **Session 2** | Part II – The Campground | Level up to 2 on arrival |
| **Session 3+** | Part III – The Mine and beyond | 2–3; level up before the sealed door |

**Note on starting level:** Begin at level 1 with maximum HP (standard 5e). Grant a free short rest immediately after the rescue — narratively, this is the moment the party loots the wagons and takes stock. Warn players before session one that level 1 is intentionally dangerous and not every encounter is meant to be fought.

| The Rescue + wagon loot | 1 |
