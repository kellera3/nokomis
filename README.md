### Part-by-Part Overview

#### Part I – The Rescue

- **File**: [`part-1-the-rescue.md`](./part-1-the-rescue.md)  
- **Focus**: Violent, cinematic introduction and immediate hook.  
- **Key Beats**:
  - PCs are prisoners in slave wagons, suffering in a frozen wasteland.  
  - Skinwalkers (led by the owl-man) ambush the caravan and slaughter the captors.  
  - The owl-man offers the PCs freedom, and a choice: go their own way, or visit the camp to repay the debt.  
- **DM Use**: Establish tone, brutality of the slavers, and the existence of skinwalkers as morally complex allies.

#### Part I-A – The Mother of Spiders

- **File**: [`part-1a-mother-of-spiders.md`](./part-1a-mother-of-spiders.md)  
- **Placement**: Between Part I (`The Rescue`) and Part II (`The Campground`).  
- **Focus**: Roleplay-heavy horror and foreshadowing of the sorcerer and his rituals.  
- **Key Beats**:
  - PCs follow directions toward Nokomis’ camp and find a cliffside cabin.  
  - Inside is **Aani of the Web**, a spiritually maimed spider-totem skinwalker.  
  - Aani’s fragmented memories reveal: the mine screams, spirits are “peeled,” and the sorcerer is harvesting skinwalkers.  
  - Optional challenges around calming, comforting, or frightening her, with minor boons and clues as rewards.  
  - Aani directs the party toward the owl-man’s camp with a rare moment of clarity.  
- **DM Use**: Deepen dread, hint at the mine’s true horror, and introduce the soul-harvesting ritual before the party ever sees the mountain.

#### Part II – The Campground

- **File**: [`part-2-the-campground.md`](./part-2-the-campground.md)  
- **Focus**: Social encounter, exposition, and alliance with Nokomis’ kinship.  
- **Key Beats**:
  - PCs arrive at a liminal, sacred-feeling skinwalker camp hidden in the forest.  
  - They meet **Headman Nokomis**, who asks for help against the mine and its vanished kin.  
  - Information about the mine: slave caravans, missing skinwalkers, lingering spirits of the dead, and something in the mountain that steals their life.  
  - Negotiation around reward (freedom-debt vs. treasure in the mine).  
  - Opportunity for the players to ask questions about the slavers, the spirits, and what lies atop and within the peak.  
- **DM Use**: Clarify stakes, set goals (“go to the mine”), and define the relationship between party and skinwalkers before the descent into horror.

#### Part III – The Mine

- **File**: [`part-3-the-mine.md`](./part-3-the-mine.md)  
- **Focus**: First contact with the mine itself: atmosphere, conditions, and the looming presence of the Master in the mountain.  
- **Key Beats**:
  - PCs ascend toward the peak where magma presses close to the surface.  
  - They witness the slave pit: mud, ash, freezing humidity, and men dying in slow misery.  
  - Environmental hazards: choking steam, exhaustion risk, warped light and oppressive soundscape.  
  - Discovery of dugouts (slave quarters, guard bunkhouse) and the **sealed ancient door**.  
  - Rumors and hints: the door opens on its own, entranced slaves walk through and never return, and an undying “Master” calls them.  
- **DM Use**: Build dread and questions right before the players cross the threshold into whatever lies under the mountain.

### Suggested Flow at the Table

- **Session 1**: Part I – The Rescue → Part I-A – The Mother of Spiders (if you want early horror/foreshadowing).  
- **Session 2**: Part II – The Campground (politics, questions, planning).  
- **Session 3+**: Part III – The Mine and deeper delves beneath the mountain (to be written/expanded).

Adjust pacing by trimming or expanding roleplay scenes (especially with Aani and Nokomis) depending on your group’s preferences.
