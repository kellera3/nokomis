After dropping: speed reduced to 5 ft. only - it cannot pursue.",Mine ceilings; purely a surprise ambush creature. Effective in a narrow passage where players cannot easily spread out.

Sunlight Sensitivity. Resist: acid / cold / fire / lightning / thunder; B/P/S non-magic. Immune: necrotic / poison.","Lingering spirit of a harvested skinwalker or slave.

Spider Climb. Web Sense. Web Walker.",Web-filled tunnels deeper than Aani's cabin. Not her kin but of the same family - use to extend the spider theme into more hostile territory.
