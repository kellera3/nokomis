## Echoes of the Mountain – Part III: The Mine

### 🎙️ Read-Aloud (Approach & First Impression)

(Slow, heavy tone; let exhaustion seep into your voice.)

> Near the peak, the earth changes. Snow thins, the air thickens, and the ground steams where liquid magma pushes to the surface, bubbling and hissing beneath a crust of black stone.
>
> The slope glows faintly orange—veins of molten light tracing cracks like the pulse of a buried heart.
>
> You see the mine: a vast pit carved into the mountainside, walls slick with mud and ash. The air is wet and freezing all at once; steam clings to your clothes, chilling you to the bone.
>
> Every breath tastes of smoke and salt. Every sound echoes—the dull rhythm of picks on rock, the distant cry of a whip, and the low moans of those who work until they can no longer stand.
>
> Torches line the pit’s edge, their light warped by steam. Below, shadows move slowly, laboring in the mud—human shapes, hunched and trembling. And above them, the guards—wrapped in furs, gripping long spears and pikes—watching like carrion birds over the dying.
>
> The ground squelches underfoot, warmed by the magma below. Here, in the heart of a volcano, men freeze to death in the mountain’s humid cold.

### 🧩 Details to Reveal During Play

1. **Origins of the Mine**: Men found gemstones; brought prisoners to work; now a grave. Magma-rich soil poisons flesh and mind.
2. **Slaves’ Conditions**: Work dawn to dusk in warm mud; rags freeze; thin broth; sleep huddled in dugouts.
3. **The Guards**: Furred, masked, cruel; ex-prisoners; pikes and intimidation.
4. **The Dugouts**: Slave quarters (rot and mold), guards’ bunkhouse (spartan), sealed door (iron-bound, ancient).
5. **The Mysterious Door**: Occasionally opens itself; slaves enter in trance; none return. “He calls to them. The Master in the mountain. The one who never dies.”

### ➡️ Transition Line

> As you near the door, the air changes. The wind dies; even the steam holds its breath. The wood groans, hinges creak, and dull heat radiates from beneath. Somewhere beyond, something moves—something that has been waiting far too long.
