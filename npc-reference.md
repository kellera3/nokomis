## 👁️ The Owl-Man

**Real name:** Unknown — he does not offer it  
**Totem:** Owl  
**Role:** First contact; rescuer; representative of Nokomis' kinship  
**First appears:** Part I – The Rescue  
**Alignment:** Neutral Good

**Appearance:**
Tall, lean, and angular. In human form his eyes are amber and unnaturally still — he does not blink at normal intervals. His clothing is layered leather and feather-trimmed hide. His daggers are always visible, worn openly, not as a threat but as a statement of honesty. In owl form he is enormous — wingspan wider than a man is tall, white-feathered, silent in flight.

**Personality:**
Economical with words. He says what is necessary and nothing else. He does not explain himself and does not expect gratitude. There is no warmth in him, but no cruelty either — he is simply a creature that operates at a different scale of urgency than most people. He killed the captor without hesitation and felt nothing worth mentioning about it.

**Speech pattern:**
Short sentences. No filler. He will wait out a silence rather than fill it.

> *"You are free. Go, or come with us. Either is acceptable."*  
> *"Debt is not punishment. It is structure."*  
> *"Ask Nokomis. That is not my answer to give."*

**What he knows:**
Everything Nokomis knows. He will not share it here — his role at the rescue is to extract, not inform. He deflects questions toward Nokomis.

**What he will not say:**
His name. Anything about himself personally. The exact location of the camp before the party agrees to come.

**DM Note:** He is not cold — he simply has no performance of warmth. If a player makes him laugh (rare), it is brief and genuine and he moves on immediately as if it didn't happen.

## 🌿 Headman Nokomis

**Totem:** Unknown — he does not shift in front of strangers  
**Role:** Quest giver; political leader of the kinship; moral anchor of the campaign  
**First appears:** Part II – The Campground  
**Alignment:** Neutral Good

**Appearance:**
Old but not frail — the kind of old that has compressed rather than diminished. Broad across the shoulders, face deeply lined, hair silver-white and worn loose. He moves slowly by choice, not necessity. His teepee is the largest in camp, decorated with painted feathers, carved bone, and the skulls of animals whose totems his people carry. He sits cross-legged near his fire when he receives guests and does not stand to greet them — they come to him.

**Personality:**
Deliberate. He thinks before speaking, and when he speaks he means every word. He is not above manipulation — he frames the party's choices carefully to make the outcome he wants feel like their idea. But he is not dishonest. He simply understands that how you ask matters as much as what you ask.

He carries grief quietly. Many of his people are missing. He does not show this in his face, but occasionally in his hands — a stillness, a pause before he continues.

**Speech pattern:**
Formal but not stiff. Uses "we" and "our kind" rather than "I." Asks questions that are actually instructions. Speaks in the present tense about the future, as if outcomes are already decided.

> *"Tell me — will you be the hands the Great Spirits use to answer our call?"*  
> *"You already owe a debt — your freedom. Still, the mine holds riches. Whatever you find, you may keep."*  
> *"The missing do not work the mine. They vanish. What is left of them — we feel near the mountain. Agony. Rage. Pain."*  
> *"I do not ask you to die for us. I ask you to go where we cannot."*

**What he knows:**
- The mine's location and general layout from scouts
- That the sorcerer is harvesting skinwalker spirits — he doesn't know the mechanism, only the result
- That the Hollow Pack exists and serves the sorcerer — he will identify them if the party describes their encounter
- That the sealed door is old — older than the mine, older than the slavers
- That no one who walks through it returns

**What he will not say unprompted:**
- That he has already lost kinship members he was close to — he will not show that wound to strangers
- That he is afraid the sorcerer may come for his camp next

**What he wants from the party:**
Find out what is happening to his people. Stop it if possible. Return alive.

**DM Note:** Nokomis is not omniscient. He has gaps in his knowledge and he acknowledges them plainly. Players who try to catch him in a contradiction will find he has none — he simply doesn't know things he doesn't know. This makes him trustworthy in a way that most quest givers are not.

## 🕷️ Aani of the Web

**Totem:** Spider — partially severed  
**Role:** Foreshadowing; boon giver (indirect); carrier of the Widow's Molar  
**First appears:** Part I-A – The Mother of Spiders  
**Alignment:** Neutral Good (confused)  
**CR:** 0 — track her HP as spiritual health, not combat health (see part-1a-mother-of-spiders.md)

**Appearance:**
An elderly woman, impossibly frail. She moves in a slow, dragging shuffle, shoulders curved inward, spine hunched as if she has been folding in on herself for years. Her hair is long and matted into thick rope-like strands that have merged with the webs around her — it is hard to see where she ends and the web begins. Eight eyes arranged across her face in two rows, several clouded with cataracts, one or two still faintly reflective in firelight. Dozens of spiders move slowly through her hair and across her shoulders at all times.

**Personality:**
She is not present in the way living people are present. Her attention drifts mid-sentence. She listens to things no one else can hear. Occasionally she is briefly, fiercely lucid — and in those moments she is precise, urgent, and frightening in her clarity. Then it passes.

She is not dangerous. She is not a threat. She is someone who has been badly hurt and kept alive by the thing that loves her most — her spider-kin.

**Speech pattern:**
Fragmented. Metaphorical. She rarely finishes a sentence the way she started it. She speaks in the present tense about things that happened in the past, and in the past tense about things that are still happening.

> *"The stone… screams."*  
> *"He peels the spirit like silk… strand by strand…"*  
> *"They don't die in there. They… unravel."*  
> *"His eyes… oh, his eyes… not man, not beast…"*  
> *"Your soul is bright… bright threads… don't let him see you."*  
> *"The owl-man waits for you. His camp breathes behind the trees. Go. Before the mountain sees you."* *(said with absolute clarity — her one fully lucid moment)*

**What she can reveal (if the party is patient):**
- The mine is spiritually active — it screams
- The sorcerer harvests totem magic by partially extracting souls
- He targets skinwalkers specifically — strong spirits, "the walking ones, the ones between forms"
- The ritual feels like being peeled, strand by strand
- The sorcerer's eyes are wrong — not human, not animal
- A direction toward Nokomis' camp

**What she gives:**
The Widow's Molar — pressed into a player's palm before they leave. She has been saving it for herself. She gives it away because she will never be well enough to use it. See part-1a-mother-of-spiders.md for mechanics.

**DM Note:** The most important thing about Aani is the sound of her. She should make players speak quietly and move carefully without being told to. If the table is loud and jokey when they arrive at the cabin, she is the reason it quiets down.

## 🕷️ The Elder Weaver

**Totem:** Spider — ancient, pure, uncorrupted  
**Role:** Boon giver; protector of Aani; potential combat encounter if attacked  
**First appears:** Part I-A – The Mother of Spiders (Elder Weaver's Chamber)  
**Alignment:** Neutral Good  
**CR:** 6 — see part-1a-mother-of-spiders.md for full stat block

**Appearance:**
A spider the size of a horse, suspended at the center of an underground cathedral of silk and stone. Her body is dark and segmented, her legs moving with slow, deliberate grace as they tend threads that stretch in every direction. All eight eyes catch the bioluminescent light of the chamber differently — some deep and still, some faintly reflective. She is enormous. The chamber is enormous. The silk threads that span it are thick as rope. She fills the space without crowding it.

**Personality:**
Ancient and unhurried. She already knows who the party is and what they did in the tunnels — she felt it through the web. She does not perform patience; she simply has it, the way mountains have it. She is not unkind. She is simply operating at a scale where most urgencies are small.

She loves Aani. This is the one thing that makes her feel immediate and present rather than vast and distant. The reunion should feel like watching something enormous become briefly, privately tender.

**Speech pattern:**
Her voice is layered — the party hears one voice but feels a secondary vibration beneath it in their chest, like a chord under a melody. She speaks in complete, unhurried sentences. She does not ask questions — she makes observations that function as questions.

> *"Mother. You came."* *(said to Aani — the only words she speaks before the reunion is complete)*  
> *"You carried her carefully. Most would not have."*  
> *"You have been seen. Not by me — by something that should not see you yet."*  
> *"I take something small. Something you will not miss until winter."*

**What she knows:**
Everything the web knows — which is most of what happens underground in a wide radius. She knows the mine exists. She knows the sorcerer's work by its resonance in the earth. She does not volunteer this information; she offers it if asked and she answers without embellishment.

**What she gives:**
The Widow's Gift boon (to all party members) and one individual boon per player — see part-1a-mother-of-spiders.md for the full boon table and the bite ritual.

**DM Note:** Do not rush the reunion scene. Give each player a moment to observe something quiet — Aani's breathing slowing, the spiders from her hair drifting to the Elder Weaver's silk, the old woman's shoulders finally dropping. The Elder Weaver in combat is a serious threat (CR 6, Legendary Actions, Lair Actions) but she will not initiate. If the party is foolish enough to attack her, they have earned what follows.

## 🐺 Vesh

**Totem:** Wolf — corrupted by stolen totem fragments  
**Role:** Antagonist (minor); sorcerer's scout; potential recurring thread  
**First appears:** Side Encounter – The Hollow Pack  
**Alignment:** Neutral Evil  
**CR:** 3 — see side-encounter-the-hollow-pack.md for full stat block

**Appearance:**
Broad-shouldered, wrapped in layered furs and leather. Her face is partially covered against the cold. When the wind shifts, her outline wavers slightly — a heat-shimmer effect, wrong in the freezing air. In wolf hybrid form her features slide and elongate; her eyes go a flat, predatory amber. She does not look threatening in the way a soldier does. She looks patient in the way a trap does.

**Personality:**
Pragmatic and cold, but not stupid. She made a deal she understood the cost of and she stands by it. She does not hate Nokomis' people — she simply chose differently, and she has stopped pretending that choice was anything other than what it was.

She will recruit if she thinks it will work. She will intimidate if it won't. She will fight if she has the advantage. She will retreat if she doesn't — without shame, without drama.

There is a seed of something salvageable in her. She knows exactly what the sorcerer is doing. She just decided the power was worth it. If she ever encounters proof that it isn't — that the cost is higher than she calculated — that seed exists.

**Speech pattern:**
Level and unhurried. She does not raise her voice. She speaks as if outcomes are already decided and she's simply informing you of them.

> *"You smell like the wagons. You got out."*  
> *"Nokomis sends people to die on that mountain. He always has. He calls it debt."*  
> *"We serve something older than kinship loyalty. Something that keeps its promises."*  
> *"You could walk away from all of it. We did."*  
> *"Remember their faces."* *(said to her pack when she calls the retreat)*

**What she knows:**
- The mine's layout — she has been inside
- The sorcerer's identity and methods, in broad strokes
- Which skinwalkers have been taken and when
- That Nokomis' camp exists and roughly where it is

**What she will not reveal:**
Anything operationally useful to someone she thinks is going to the mine to fight the sorcerer.

**DM Note:** If the party let her go without a fight, she reported them to the sorcerer. Guards at the mine may be expecting visitors. If the party fought her and she retreated, she remembers. She may reappear later. If a player engaged seriously with her pitch about the debt being a trap, that is a thread worth pulling in a later session.

## 🏔️ The Master in the Mountain

**Totem:** All of them — stolen, harvested, accumulated  
**Role:** Primary antagonist  
**First appears:** Part III and beyond  
**Alignment:** Neutral Evil  
**CR:** To be determined based on party level at time of encounter — build the stat block before session 3

**What is known:**
- He does not die — or has not died in a very long time
- He harvests skinwalker totem spirits by partially extracting them while the host is alive
- He absorbs these spirits, accumulating totem power across many victims
- He has Legendary Resistances
- He calls to slaves in trance — they walk through the sealed door and do not return
- His eyes are wrong — "not man, not beast" (Aani's words)
- Animal shapes press outward from beneath his skin — the stolen souls, restless inside him

**The Soul Revolt mechanic:**
If the party carries the Widow's Molar and uses it, the first hit transmits Aani's concentrated venom into him. Each subsequent hit adds 1 Revolting Soul — stacking 1d8 psychic damage per soul at the start of his turns. See part-1a-mother-of-spiders.md for the full counter table and thresholds.

**Speech pattern (suggested):**
When he speaks, more than one voice is in it — the stolen souls pressing through. He does not need to threaten. He is simply present, and presence is enough.

> *"You carry something of hers. I can feel it."*  
> *"They are still in here. All of them. They remember your names."*

**DM Note:** Build his stat block at CR 8–10 for a level 4–5 party. He should have at least 3 Legendary Resistances, a multiattack using stolen totem abilities (claws, bite, psychic, cold, fire — mix of forms), and the Soul Revolt counter running openly on the table. The visual of animal shapes pressing outward from beneath his skin at each threshold is the centerpiece of the fight — narrate it vividly at every step.
