## Echoes of the Mountain – Side Encounter: The Gorged

### 📌 Placement

This encounter can be inserted at any of three points in the campaign. Its meaning shifts depending on when it lands.

| Placement | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Before Part I-A** (between the rescue and Aani's cabin) | First hint something terrible is happening at the mine. The players have no context yet — which makes it worse. |
| **After Part I-A** (between Aani's cabin and the campground) | The bodies confirm what Aani said in fragments: *"They don't die in there. They… unravel."* Now the players see where they end up. |
| **After Part II** (between the campground and the mine approach) | The bodies feel like a direct consequence of what Nokomis asked them to stop. The scale of death is no longer abstract. |

Place it wherever your session pacing needs a beat of dread.

### 🎙️ Read-Aloud (Something in the Trees)

Read this before the players see what the creature is eating. Keep your voice low and unhurried.

> The trail passes through a stretch of older pines — taller, darker, the canopy thick enough that the snow barely reaches the ground here.
>
> Ahead, something moves.
>
> Large. Low to the ground. The sound reaches you before the shape does: a wet, rhythmic tearing, steady and patient. Not frantic — not the noise of hunger. Something more settled than that.
>
> A shape resolves in the dark between the trunks. Bear-sized. Bear-shaped.
>
> It has not noticed you yet.

*(Pause. Let the players decide whether to approach or stop.)*

### 🎙️ Read-Aloud (Getting Closer)

Read this when the players move close enough to see clearly, or if they fail a Stealth check and the creature lifts its head.

> You see what it is feeding on.
>
> A pile — bodies, stacked loosely against the base of the tree line. A dozen, maybe more. Men and women in work rags, skin darkened by cold and ash, hands wrapped in frozen cloth. Some are half-buried in snow. Others are not.
>
> The bear does not look like it arrived here recently. Its fur is matted and dark in patches. Its movements are slow. Deliberate. Like something that has been here a long time and intends to stay.
>
> It lifts its head.
>
> The eyes catch the light wrong — not the bright mirror-flash of an animal's eyes in the dark, but a dull, deep amber. Like coals that have been burning too long.
>
> It watches you.
>
> It does not run.

### 📌 DM Reference — What the Creature Is

This is a cave bear that discovered the dump site weeks or months ago and has not left since. The bodies carry trace residue of the sorcerer's work — the spiritual corruption that saturates the mine seeps into the dead. It is not enough to kill the bear. It is enough to change it.

The bear is not undead. It is not a spirit. It is still an animal. But it has been feeding on something wrong for long enough that it no longer behaves like a normal creature. It does not fear fire. It does not flee when injured. It watches with a stillness that predators do not usually have — patient in a way that feels less like ambush instinct and more like it simply does not understand why anything would leave.

**What is visibly wrong:**
- Eyes that reflect light amber rather than white
- Wounds from previous encounters that have not fully closed — old slashes on the flank, still slightly damp
- It does not vocalize. No growl. No warning sounds. Just stillness, then motion.
- Its blood, when it bleeds, is too dark — nearly black at the edges of a wound

A player who succeeds on a **DC 14 Arcana or Nature check** senses that the wrongness is not the creature's origin — it is something it absorbed. It is still an animal. Whatever is in it came from outside.

### 👁️ The Pile of Bodies — What Players Find

The bodies are workers from the mine — men and women who died on shift and were carried here and left. The pile is not hidden; it is simply far enough from the road that no passing caravan would see it without looking.

Players who search the pile find evidence of how these people died and how they were worked:

- **Tool wounds**: crushed fingers and hands — the marks of collapsed rock, dropped loads, pinch points in machinery they were not trained to operate
- **Frostbite**: blackened extremities, feet and hands that froze through inadequate wrappings
- **Starvation**: visible in the faces — hollowed, skin taut against bone. These people were not fed enough to do the work they were made to do.
- **Clothing**: strips of canvas and sacking, wound around limbs as insulation. The same material the party was wearing in the cage.
- **Sheer number**: With a **DC 11 Investigation check**, a player can estimate these bodies accumulated over months — not weeks. This has been happening for a long time.

There is nothing of material value here. That is the point.

**DM Note:** Do not rush this. Give each player who searches a moment to describe what their character sees or does with what they find. The horror of this scene is not in the creature — it is in the evidence. The creature just got here first.

### ⚔️ The Gorged — Stat Block

*Large beast (corrupted), unaligned*

| | |
|---|---|
| **AC** | 13 (natural armor) |
| **HP** | 59 (7d10 + 21) |
| **Speed** | 40 ft. |

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |

**Skills:** Perception +1  
**Damage Resistances:** Cold, Necrotic  
**Condition Immunities:** Frightened  
**Senses:** Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 11

---

**Keen Smell.** The Gorged has advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell.

**Feeding Trance.** While actively feeding and not having taken damage in the current encounter, the Gorged is absorbed in its work. It is aware of its surroundings but slow to prioritize threats — see Stealth option below.

**Corruption Swell.** When the Gorged is reduced to 0 HP, its body shudders and dark fluid spreads from its wounds. Each creature within 5 feet must succeed on a **DC 13 Constitution saving throw** or be **poisoned until the end of its next turn**.

---

**Actions**

**Multiattack.** The Gorged makes two attacks: one with its Claws and one with its Bite.

- **Claws.** *Melee weapon attack.* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2d6 + 5 slashing damage.

- **Bite.** *Melee weapon attack.* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2d8 + 5 piercing damage.

---

**DM Note on Combat:** The Gorged does not posture or warn. When it decides to engage, it moves. It targets the nearest creature first and does not switch targets unless that creature is downed or moves out of reach. It will not retreat — not from fire, not from spells, not from being reduced to low HP. It simply continues until it cannot.

Narrate its silence throughout the fight. No roaring. No growling. Just the sound of its movement and impact.

---

### 🌲 Stealth / Avoidance Option

Players who do not want to fight can attempt to move past the creature quietly.

**Group Stealth Check:** All players make a Stealth check; use the lowest result.

| Result | Outcome |
|---|---|
| **DC 13 or higher** | The Gorged registers movement but returns to feeding. The party passes. |
| **DC 8–12** | The creature follows at distance — 60 ft. back, matching the party's pace through the trees for several minutes before eventually falling behind. Make it uncomfortable. |
| **Below DC 8** | The Gorged abandons the pile and closes. Roll initiative. |

### 🔊 Sound

**Distraction:** A player who throws food, creates a loud sound on the far side of the pile, or otherwise gives the creature a reason to look away grants the group **advantage** on the Stealth check. The Gorged is still an animal — it can be fooled.

---

### 🔸 After the Encounter

However it resolves — fight, stealth, or a tense stand-off — the pile of bodies remains.

The party carries this forward. They know, now, that the mine kills its workers in numbers large enough to require a dump site. They know something has been feeding here long enough to change. And they know that the site is close enough to the trail that whoever runs the mine either does not care if it is found, or does not expect anyone to look.

**Optional transition line (if moving toward the mine):**

> The trees close behind you.
>
> The sound of feeding — or the silence where it was — follows you longer than it should.
