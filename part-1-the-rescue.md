## Echoes of the Mountain – Part I: The Rescue

### 🎙️ Read-Aloud (Opening Scene)

> The horse-drawn wagon shifts and sways as its large, iron-rimmed wheels grind through ice-encrusted snow. You and your companions huddle in the corner of a wooden cage, threadbare tunics and leggings doing little against the bitter wind that cuts through every gap in the boxy wagon. The cage, built entirely of thick oak planks, has no windows or slats, only a small iron-barred vent near the top for air.
>
> (Pause.) Days ago, you realized your clothing was stitched from old food sacks—and you doubt you were the first to wear them. You pull your knees tight and peer through a knothole in the wall… your only glimpse of the world beyond.
>
> (Tone softens—wonder mixed with dread.) Snowflakes churn through the air as barren trees shudder and moan beneath the howling wind—the only sound besides the creaks and groans of the frozen wagon. Iron bearings whine with each turn, wooden joints clack in protest. You never imagined you’d find a place worse than the stone cell you sat in for weeks… but this is worse.
>
> One captor drives your wagon. Another drives the one behind, also full of human cargo. Two more ride alongside on horseback, keeping a constant, watchful eye.
>
> (Short pause—shift to curiosity and unease.) Through your knothole, you’ve watched the world change—desert, to forest, to endless frozen wasteland. Then your gaze catches something strange: a coyote, loping silently through the trees at the same pace as the wagon. You glimpse it between branches—paws barely breaking the snow’s surface—yet with each glance its form changes. Feet grow larger. Legs thicken. The gait rises upright. Claws become fingers; fur fades into thick leggings; paws become human feet wrapped in leather moccasins. (Hushed.) Then… it stops, and disappears among the trees.
>
> You elbow your companions, whispering for silence as your heart pounds. All around, animals gather; the forest seems to close in. A white owl perches silently over the trail. Squirrels and chipmunks chatter and leap. A beaver waddles across wind-hardened snow, tail dragging; it stands upright, eyes far too intelligent for an animal.
>
> Your captors notice. They call to each other—alarmed. The driver behind you snaps the reins—a shriek splits the storm—THWACK! An arrow bursts through his throat, pinning him to the seat as blood pours down his fur coat. Another scream from your own driver—then silence.
>
> The horses rear; the wagon tips—you’re thrown sideways as the cage crashes into the snow, the world shuddering to a stop. The team breaks free and bolts into the trees.
>
> (Lower voice for tension.) A mounted captor flees down the trail—but the owl is upon him in an instant. Wings become arms; feathers become blades. The owl-man drops from the sky, landing atop the rider; daggers plunge into the man’s eyes. He tumbles from the horse, clawing at his bleeding face. The owl-man lands lightly in the snow—now fully human.
>
> (Dramatic pause.) The wind stills. No creak of wagons. No thunder of hooves. Only the captor’s screams, echoing through the frozen air—until the owl-man steps forward and drives a dagger into his heart. The body slumps into the snow. The forest falls silent once more.

### 📌 DM Reference

- **Tone & Pace**: Start chaotic and sensory-dense; slow once the owl-man appears.
- **Exit Beat**: A skinwalker (owl-man) addresses the party briefly: they are free to go, or they may visit the camp to learn how to repay the debt. The skinwalkers shift back to animal forms and vanish.
