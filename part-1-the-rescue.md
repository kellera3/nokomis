### 🎙️ Read-Aloud (Opening Scene)

> The horse-drawn wagon shifts and sways as its large, iron-rimmed wheels grind through ice-encrusted snow. You and your companions huddle in the corner of a wooden cage, threadbare tunics and leggings doing little against the bitter wind that cuts through every gap in the boxy wagon. The cage, built entirely of thick oak planks, has no windows or slats, only a small iron-barred vent near the top for air.
>
> (Pause.) Days ago, you realized your clothing was stitched from old food sacks—and you doubt you were the first to wear them. You pull your knees tight and peer through a knothole in the wall… your only glimpse of the world beyond.
>
> (Tone softens—wonder mixed with dread.) Snowflakes churn through the air as barren trees shudder and moan beneath the howling wind—the only sound besides the creaks and groans of the frozen wagon. Iron bearings whine with each turn, wooden joints clack in protest. You never imagined you’d find a place worse than the stone cell you sat in for weeks… but this is worse.
>
> One captor drives your wagon. Another drives the one behind, also full of human cargo. Two more ride alongside on horseback, keeping a constant, watchful eye.
>
> (Short pause—shift to curiosity and unease.) Through your knothole, you’ve watched the world change—desert, to forest, to endless frozen wasteland. Then your gaze catches something strange: a coyote, loping silently through the trees at the same pace as the wagon. You glimpse it between branches—paws barely breaking the snow’s surface—yet with each glance its form changes. Feet grow larger. Legs thicken. The gait rises upright. Claws become fingers; fur fades into thick leggings; paws become human feet wrapped in leather moccasins. (Hushed.) Then… it stops, and disappears among the trees.
>
> You elbow your companions, whispering for silence as your heart pounds. All around, animals gather; the forest seems to close in. A white owl perches silently over the trail. Squirrels and chipmunks chatter and leap. A beaver waddles across wind-hardened snow, tail dragging; it stands upright, eyes far too intelligent for an animal.
>
> Your captors notice. They call to each other—alarmed. The driver behind you snaps the reins—a shriek splits the storm—THWACK! An arrow bursts through his throat, pinning him to the seat as blood pours down his fur coat. Another scream from your own driver—then silence.
>
> The horses rear; the wagon tips—you’re thrown sideways as the cage crashes into the snow, the world shuddering to a stop. The team breaks free and bolts into the trees.
>
> (Lower voice for tension.) A mounted captor flees down the trail—but the owl is upon him in an instant. Wings become arms; feathers become blades. The owl-man drops from the sky, landing atop the rider; daggers plunge into the man’s eyes. He tumbles from the horse, clawing at his bleeding face. The owl-man lands lightly in the snow—now fully human.
>
> (Dramatic pause.) The wind stills. No creak of wagons. No thunder of hooves. Only the captor’s screams, echoing through the frozen air—until the owl-man steps forward and drives a dagger into his heart. The body slumps into the snow. The forest falls silent once more.

### 📌 DM Reference

- **Tone & Pace**: Start chaotic and sensory-dense; slow once the owl-man appears.
- **Exit Beat**: A skinwalker (owl-man) addresses the party briefly: they are free to go, or they may visit the camp to learn how to repay the debt. The skinwalkers shift back to animal forms and vanish.

---

### 🎒 Loot Reference — If the Party Searches the Scene

The party begins with nothing — food-sack tunics and no gear. Everything here is a meaningful upgrade. The skinwalkers have no interest in the captors' belongings and will not interfere with looting.

**Note on the horses:** Both wagon teams broke free and bolted. The mounted captor's horse fled after the owl-man dropped from it. No mounts are recoverable.

**Note on other prisoners:** The rear wagon also held human cargo. They are freed when the cage breaks open, but they are not allies — they scatter into the wilderness. A sentence of acknowledgment is enough.

#### 🎒 Starting Equipment — Personal Gear in the Wagons

The slavers confiscated everything when they took the party prisoner, but they didn't destroy it — they stored it. Each PC's starting equipment (per their class and background) was packed into the wagons for transport, likely to be sold or redistributed at the destination.

**Where to find it:**

- **Party's wagon** (tipped): Personal gear is scattered inside the cage or packed in a wooden crate wedged beneath the bench. A PC who searches finds their own belongings with a **Perception DC 10** check; on a failure, the item is buried under snow or debris and requires 10 minutes of digging to recover.
- **Rear wagon** (upright): Any gear belonging to prisoners from the second wagon is stacked in a locked chest behind the driver's bench — opened with the ring of keys or a DC 13 Thieves' Tools check.

**Condition:** Everything is intact but cold, damp, and crammed together. Spellbooks, journals, and parchment may have moisture damage at the edges — cosmetic only, still functional.

**DM Note on spellbooks:** If a wizard is in the party, their spellbook is in the wagon — the slavers would have recognized it as valuable cargo rather than destroying it. It is recoverable.

**DM Note on hidden items:** Players may declare that their character kept one or two small concealable items on their person during capture (a holy symbol sewn into clothing, a hidden dagger, a lockpick). Approve these before the session. Anything that could plausibly go undetected during a search is reasonable; anything bulky or obvious is not.

#### From the Two Wagon Drivers

Each driver carries:

- **Fur coat** — heavy, warm, bloodstained at the front (arrow wounds). Functions as a *winter cloak*; wearing one removes the risk of cold exhaustion during travel in the freeze. One coat is pinned under the driver still slumped in the rear wagon's seat.
- **Belt knife** (dagger) — utility blade, well-used
- **Belt pouch** — 10–15 sp each
- **Wool clothing and boots** — a full set. Far better than food-sack tunics.

One driver also carries:
- **Ring of iron keys** — fits the cage padlocks and the manacles inside

---

#### From the Two Mounted Captors

Better equipped than the drivers — these men were responsible for keeping prisoners in line at range.

- **Short sword** (one captor) and **hand axe** (the other)
- **Crossbow** with **20 bolts** — one of the two carried this; useful for controlling prisoners without closing distance
- **Hardened leather coat** (*leather armor*) — one captor wore it; the other had only thick layered clothing
- **Riding gloves and boots**
- **Payment pouch** — the best-dressed captor carried the operation's travel funds: 80–120 sp and 2–4 gp

---

#### From the Wagons

Both wagons are oak cage constructions. The party's wagon is tipped on its side in the snow; the rear wagon is upright with its dead driver still pinned to the seat.

**Shared supplies (both wagons):**

- **Manacles and chains** — iron, heavy. Four sets. Grim to carry; worth selling.
- **Rope** — 50 feet per wagon (100 ft. total)
- **Lanterns** (3) with **oil flasks** (6) — they were traveling in a frozen wasteland at uncertain hours
- **Trail rations** — dried meat, hardtack. Enough for 7–10 days for the whole party
- **Wool blankets** — several per wagon; kept cargo alive in transit
- **Wagon repair tools** — hammer, iron spikes, hand saw, spare bolts

**Rear wagon only** (upright, easier to search):

- **Locked strongbox** under the driver's bench — requires the ring of keys or a DC 13 Thieves' Tools check. Contains: 80–120 sp, 2–4 gp, and a folded travel document (see below).

**Party's wagon** (tipped, partially buried):

- Same general supplies, but scattered. A PC who searches it makes a **Perception DC 12** check; on a failure, they find nothing before the snow buries it further.

#### 📄 The Travel Manifest

Found in the strongbox or on the best-dressed mounted captor.

A folded sheet of heavy paper, written in a cipher or unfamiliar script. Legible elements (even to those who cannot read the language): a rough headcount of "cargo," a destination mark or seal, and a name — one that may mean nothing now, but could resurface when the party reaches the mine or encounters the sorcerer.

**DM Note:** Leave the name and seal deliberately vague for now. Fill it in when you know more about who commissioned the slaver operation. The document's value is as a thread, not an answer.
